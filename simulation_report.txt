===== BIO-HAZARD CLEANING AGENT SIMULATION REPORT =====

1. Data Structures Used:
- 2D numpy arrays for environment grid
- Lists for storing clean, inaccessible, and bio-hazard coordinates
- List for storing agent path
- List for storing collected bio-hazard coordinates

2. Algorithm Description:
- Initialize environment (100x100 grid) with inaccessible areas and random bio-hazards
- Initialize agent at a random clean cell
- While agent is active:
    - Randomly select movement direction
    - Check if next cell is accessible and not visited
    - Move agent to new cell
    - If the cell has bio-hazard, collect and mark as cleaned
    - Stop if no valid moves or next cell is inaccessible

3. Test Data:
- Environment size: 100x100
- Bio-hazard cells placed: 1000
- Random starting position of agent: (4, 46)

4. Console Output:
Stop reason: Next move inaccessible
Total steps taken: 17
Total waste collected: 2
Percentage of bio-hazard cleaned: 0.20%
Average steps per waste collected: 8.50
Total path length: 18
